Despite promising growth in renewables, power sector emissions had the largest sectoral growth
。。。
Reductions in emissions from natural gas were more than replaced by emissions from coal
。。。。

Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions reached 41.3 Gt CO2-eq in 2022

Total energy-related greenhouse gas emissions increased by 1.0% to an all-time high of 41.3 Gt CO2-eq (see “Data sources and method” for global warming potential values). CO2 emissions from energy combustion and industrial process accounted for 89% of energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2022.

Methane from energy combustion, leaks and venting represented another 10%, mostly coming from onshore oil and gas operations as well as steam coal production. Methane emissions rose to nearly 135 Mt CH4 or around 4 Gt CO2-eq in 2022, despite high natural gas prices that increased the cost effectiveness of methane abatement technologies.
